## My Recommendation: 🌐 CLOUD

**Why?** 
- Much more convenient in the long run
- You can check your commissions from anywhere
- It looks more professional if you share it
- Free tier is very generous
- You can always switch to local later if you want

**But LOCAL is fine if:**
- You just want to test it out first
- You have privacy concerns (though cloud is also secure)
- You really don't want to create accounts

## Ready to Start?

1. **Pick your path** (Cloud or Local)
2. **Open the guide** (CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md or BEGINNER_GUIDE.md)
3. **Follow step by step** - don't skip ahead!
4. **Use the checklist** to track your progress

## Need Help?

All guides assume you've **never done this before** and explain everything in plain English.

If you get stuck:
1. Read the troubleshooting section in your guide
2. Make sure you followed every step exactly
3. Try again from the beginning (it's okay!)
